        <p>
          The Mozilla Festival respects Mozilla's <a title="community participation guidelines" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/">community participation guidelines</a>. These guidelines  cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, vendors, and anyone else involved in making the MozFest possible.
        </p>

        <h4>Inclusion and Diversity</h4>
        <p>
          The Mozilla Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community and everybody at the Mozilla Festival, including, but not limited to people of varied age, ability, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious & political views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mozilla-based activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.
        </p>

        <h4>How we treat each other</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Be respectful and welcoming</li>
          <li>Try to understand different perspectives</li>

          <li>Empower others</li>
