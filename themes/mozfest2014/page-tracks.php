        <h2>How the MozFest Program Works</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        MozFest is built each year on core <b>"tracks",</b> which are clusters of topics and sessions that we believe have the greatest potential for innovation and empowerment with the web. <b>Each track is curated by "Space Wranglers",</b> who are thought-leaders and community organizers in that particular topic. The tracks are spread across the entire venue and are the <b>central programmatic focus of the festival.</b>

                <h3>Build and Teach the Web</h3>
                <h4>Keep the web wild through hands-on making with innovative tools and teaching the web as a community. </h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                Let's build and teach the web together. From remixing public archives to mashing hip hop with politics, and from hacking on web-native storytelling tools to knitting projects that teach digital literacies, we'll inspire, share and empower. Get your feet wet by programming your first webpage, browse our art galleries, play with the Green Screen and help others with their making "to dos".

                <h3>Open Web With Things</h3>
                <h4>Escape the limitations of your computer and build the web using sensors, circuits and good old paper and scissors.</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                The web for most of you is rectangular. You live, work and play in a web that's experienced entirely through a flat rectangular screen.
              </p>
              <p>
                The "Internet of Things" promises so much more. A web of any shape, in any object in any location. Yet it's been hijacked. The "Internet Of Things" is potentially a turning back of the clock by 25 years to a time when private companies could have their individual locked down internet. An internet for them and not for us.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the heart of this track is the principle of sharing and empowering open knowledge around the web, things, and people. Taking a humanistic and ethical approach, think about the new experiences and tension points of 6 billion people and 2^128 things on an open web.

                It's no secret that mobile technology is a big thing, and, as people adopt new pocket-sized technology around the world, it's only getting bigger. There is a great opportunity to make an incredible, lasting, fun, interactive impact using another realm of technology that's carved its placed into our lives: the web -- still a relatively new and unclaimed space.
              </p>

                What can the mobile web do now? Where is it going? How do we help it grow and thrive, while staying useful, open and friendly? How can we enable and encourage new users around the world while leveraging the tiniest, bleeding-edge technology in our pockets? Excelsior!

                Our engagement in the open web is changing expectations about the way journalism is done, and though the business of newsgathering is in flux, the practice is stronger than ever. Now we have the opportunity to make newsgathering a more collaborative process, developing compelling stories, driven by data, that change the world we live in. Join us in discussions, hands-on making, and wireframing, and help explore new ways to visualize data, present information, and foster connections between people interested in harnessing the power of the web to create great journalism.

                <h4>An exploration of the programs, practices and inspirations of open and networked digital art forms. </h4>

              <p>
                As the Internet becomes increasingly ubiquitous around the world, more and more web users are making the transition from consumers to creators, merging art, technology and networks to build new and surprising digital art forms with unprecedented results.
              </p>
              <p>
                What might the combination of these experiments in theory, code and creativity — a practice we refer to as "networked art" — mean for cultural heritage organizations, artists, technologists and curators? And how might creative works inform our understandings of the open web's key challenges, from privacy to ownership, and from identity to governance?
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's shape the future of networked art together by breaking down old dichotomies between creator and patron. We welcome your craziest ideas for live art-making, creative collaboration and skills-sharing.

                Step on to the Open Badges Yellow Brick Road with us at this year's Mozfest and get hands on by earning badges throughout the festival, creating your own and helping shape the future of the Open Badges ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
                2013 / 14 has been an exciting year for the Open Badges community Over 14,000 organisations are now issuing Open Badges worldwide. Employers, Universities, non-profits, and schools are working together to create a new global skills currency.
              </p>
              <p>
                This year we're showcasing fantastic examples of badges in action. Hear from the people who have designed, built and issued their badges, dive in and earn badges yourself, and have a look behind the curtain at the tools processes you'll need to create your own badge scheme.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're new to badges, don't worry, you'll find friends, advice, inspiration and tools to help you on your journey. We'd love to hear about your Open Badge plans, projects or badges ahead of Mozfest, tell us about the here: <a href="http://www.badgetheworld.org/">www.badgetheworld.org</a>. And if you have a bite sized badges earning activity you'd like to feature on the badge from get in touch!

                <h3>Policy & Advocacy</h3>
                <h4>Build the Web We Want: Protecting and advancing the free and open web for everyone.</h4>

              <p>
                The Internet brings together societies and empowers people to make anything and share with anyone. But as a result of policies that undermine access to the web and massive government surveillance, we are at risk of losing the essential ethos of the Internet itself. We are at a critical point in history to protect and advance the free and open Internet. This track will explore the current state of public policy, what is needed and how to mobilize people to hold their leaders accountable to stronger privacy, security, net neutrality, free expression and access to the web.

                <h3>Community Building</h3>

              <p>
                Through hands-on sessions and group work we'll explore what challenges a distributed, global community is best at tackling. We’ll look at how being different and unique is our strength, and how our local knowledge can fuel and inform a global movement.
              </p>
              <p>
                We'll learn from each other how to create sustainable and outcome-driven collaborations, how to join forces with other organizations to maximise our impact. We’ll examine case studies of healthy governance processes and feedback loops which can help us be open, mindful and transparent.
              </p>
              <p>
                We'll look into the power of collective mobilisation, identify meaningful actions, understand how metrics can improve our efforts, and learn how to empower ourselves and others to be the force and heart of the global Open Web movement.
